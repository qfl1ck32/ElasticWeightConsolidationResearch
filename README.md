## Continuous Learning - Researching catastrophic forgetting in Neural Networks

###### This research project was meant for the Deep Learning course, in the third year of my bachelor's degree, at the University of Bucharest.

###### We have implemented the idea of _Elastic Weight Consolidation_, mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796.pdf), and have tested a ResNet50 model, both pretrained and non-pretrained, with and without EWC, on the [CLEAR dataset](https://clear-benchmark.github.io/).
